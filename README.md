## Find Lost Bitcoin Passphrases

**Find your lost passphrase get 50% of the find**</br>
Search passphrases on the fastest program in the world</br>
[18,972](https://allprivatekeys.com/hacked-brainwallets-with-balance) passphrases were found, an estimated 5,000 passphrases are lost</br>
They were found on a processor with a maximum speed of 100,000 characters per second.</br>
Challenge Speed 3090 = 180,000,000/sec. It's 1800 times faster.</br>
The fact that one 3090 GPU runs in 24 hours is a [legendary CPU program](https://github.com/ryancdotorg/brainflayer) in 5 years.</br>

How to search for old lost passphrases:</br>
If you have a GPU and are ready to search for a key **24/7**</br>

If you do not have a GPU card, you can [**rent**](https://vast.ai) it and participate in a collective search. </br>
For some users, [**renting**](https://vast.ai) is cheaper than searching on their own PC. There is also less noise in the house.</br>
When renting, you must take into account the risk that the key may not be found at all.</br> 
You may incur losses. Think of it not as earnings, but as a lottery.

In the [**TABLE**](https://github.com/phrutis/BrainWords/blob/main/Others/Table.md), select a **FREE** range between 1-10000

**Write in telrgram [**BrainWords**](https://t.me/+3nnvdGjPsFlkNWYy)  start 1234** (the range you took)</br>
I will add your range to [**TABLE**](https://github.com/phrutis/BrainWords/blob/main/Others/Table.md) in progress</br>
This is to keep your range from being picked up by other hunters.</br>
This will save you from re-passing and confusion. This will speed up the search.<hr>

If you have any difficulties with the launch, you can ask in telegram [**BrainWords**](https://t.me/+3nnvdGjPsFlkNWYy)<hr>

How does the bot version work?</br>
This is the version for those who have rigs.</br>
Specify your telegram bot and id</br>
If there is a find, your bot will notify you in telegrams.</br>
Also, the standard message about the find will be in the window and will be written to the FOUND.txt file</br>
When the range is over, the bot will send you Passed hex id</br>

To test the bot, use ```-range 1```</br>
When the total is 10,000,000,000 on the counter, FOUND address 15NttyDMPPu4mTejeAr9Dojsr7HgzoXfat</br>
Example:</br>
Run: ```BrainWords2.exe -bits 18 -range 1 -a addresses.txt -bot 5889364881:ABG0X3XU0zvZQ5ELtR-EYR7F9OfAEVHBFeQ -id 757817039```</br>

How to create a [telegram bot](https://sendpulse.com/knowledge-base/chatbot/create-telegram-chatbot)</br>
How to find out your id in telegram, add [Get My ID_bot](https://t.me/getmyid_bot) /start</br>
This version BrainWords2.exe requires internet to work.<hr>

Where can I get a base of addresses to start?</br>
You can download the database of addresses [**HERE**](https://github.com/phrutis/BrainWords/releases/tag/1.0)<hr>

Why did the program freeze at startup?</br>
She didn't hang up! Program start 3090 -bits25 (20-25 min.)</br>
The program creates tables and downloads to the device</br>
One card requires 4GB or more of RAM to work.</br>
The consumption depends on the size of the table (-bits) and the size of the address file.<hr>

What address formats can be uploaded?</br>
All bc.., 3.., 1.., in a text file from a new line</br>
It is recommended to use only [OLD addresses 1... from $2](https://github.com/phrutis/BrainWords/releases/tag/1.0)<hr>

How to continue searching after stopping the program?</br>
The program saves the position every 2-3 minutes.</br>
Windows run bat file 7777_0_Continue.bat</br>
Linux copy the startup line from the tex file 7777_0_Continue.txt and run the program.<hr>

Explain what we are looking for?</br>
How it works? What's this?</br>
[Here is a good example](https://allprivatekeys.com/try-your-passphrase) of work for you.</br>
Enter passphrase: fhqyqzhao123 pay attention to the address 1MVFUmYLKmLyC1m3WfyHkEJTZfoHjwDeXE</br>
The difference is that instead of requests to the blockchain.</br> 
The program checks against the database of addresses with a positive balance.<hr>

I found. What to do?</br>
When you find the passphrase, a message will appear in the window.</br>
====== FOUND ======</br>
Address: 1.....</br>
Privkey: XXX...</br>
===================</br>
The address and key will also be written to the text file FOUND.txt</br>
Do not tell anyone the found key!</br>
Write me a private message in telegram phrutis<hr>

What are we looking for?</br>
```BrainWords.exe``` - all possible combinations + spec. symbols</br>
Length 8, 9. Example: paxx7a0*Z, SaTellitE, %#j)xQ78~"<hr>

What is HEX id?</br>
When you pass the range by 100%, the program will end the search.</br>
It will be written in the window.</br>
Range 1234 - Passed</br>
HEX id XXX......</br>
A text file PASSED-HASHES.txt is also created
Send in telegram [**BrainWords**](https://t.me/+3nnvdGjPsFlkNWYy)</br>
Range number and HEX id.</br>
I will mark in the table that the range has been passed.</br>
This is done so that hunters do not take already passed ranges and do not pass the same thing.</br>
Feel free to send me a HEX id - it will speed up the search and save time and costs.<hr>

Why does the program use a lot of RAM?</br>
The program creates the necessary tables and stores them in memory.<hr>

Does the program require an internet connection?</br>
No, the program is looking for the key offline.<hr>

Why is the program without source codes?</br>
The program includes a range, decoders and more.</br>
Knowing them, there is no point in the challenge.<hr>

If I find the key can I take all the coins for myself?</br>
No, you will find BTC address and the encrypted key.</br>
Only the organizers of the challenge can decrypt this key and pay you a 50% from balance<hr>

Can you sell me the full version of the program?</br>
No, the program is not for sale.<hr>

What guarantees are there that you will pay me 50% when I find the private key?</br>
If you have found several addresses, start small and build up.</br>
There are no guarantees anywhere, the challenge is designed for trust.<hr>

I have a RTX 3060 TI card, and I have a low speed, how can speed up?</br>
In the new drivers for 30xx Ti, a limiter is installed that slows down the speed by half.</br>
You need to download the old driver from six months ago. 496.13</br>
Delete the new driver, install the old driver, the speed will increase x2</br>
After searching, you can install new drivers.<hr>

What is a range?</br>
This is a small part of the given symbols for passing a certain segment.</br>
All possible characters are applied (including special characters)</br>
Example range 7777</br>
Start characters: 
abbccddd -> abbccdde -> abbc(0d8 -> abH$&@#*</br>
Finish: acZZZZZZZ<hr>

Is this theft?</br>
If the found address is 5-12 years old without movement, it is a lost coin.<hr>

What are the best ranges to look for?</br>
Where are the chances?</br>
I think 1-100, but you just need to hope for luck<hr>

### A little explanation about the program in two modes.</br>
The first mode is clear.</br>
The letters are converted to sha256 at the output, we get a private key.</br>
An address is made from a private key, reconciliation against a database of addresses.</br>

The second mode is hepatic.</br>
Each private key is unique (valid)</br>
If we discard the first mode, we have a 100% valid random number of private keys at a speed of 180.000.000/sec</br>
What according to my hypothesis ([ru](https://github.com/phrutis/Rotor/issues/3)) gives more speed.</br>

The bottom line is that there are many ranges, this is a long distance.</br>
There is a high probability of finding a collision.</br>
Thus, you can find an address from the address database that was not originally created from a passphrase.</br>
Perhaps it was generated randomly, it's just that its private key matches the passphrase.</br>
If you find an address with recent transactions, I advise you not to touch it. It's someone's savings.</br>
#### We are looking for old coins (no movement), lost ones!<hr>

All inactive hunters in the group will be deleted without warning.</br>
When you start actively searching, you can add yourself to the group again.</br>
Bands that are more than 2 weeks in progress are released without notice.<hr>
